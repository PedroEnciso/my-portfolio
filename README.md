This is my portfolio created with React.

For this project, I chose to create a data file containing all of my projects so I don't have to manually create eachproject component. Instead I could use the map() array function to create all projects. Being new to react, this capability is one of my favorites so far because it keeps code short and readable, and it's really easy to add new components.
